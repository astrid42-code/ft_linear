Project:
Create a program that predicts the price of a car by
using a linear function train with a gradient descent algorithm.
implement a simple linear regression with a single feature - in this case, the
mileage of the car

two programs:
1 = predict the price of a car for a given mileage
    - prompt you for a mileage, and then give
    you back the estimated price for that mileage. 
    hypothesis to predict the price :
    estimatePrice(mileage) = θ0 + (θ1 ∗ mileage)
    - Before the run of the training program,
    theta0 and theta1 will be set to 0.

2 =  train your model. It will read your dataset file
    and perform a linear regression on the data
    - Once the linear regression has completed, 
    you will save the variables theta0 and
    theta1 for use in the first program.
    formulas :
    cf subject

Note that the estimatePrice is the same as in our first program,
but here it uses your temporary, lastly computed theta0 and theta1.
Also, don’t forget to simultaneously update theta0 and theta1

Bonus (mais 2 premiers bien a faire pour le projet en fait,
pour mieux visualiser la data)
• Plotting the data into a graph to see their repartition.
• Plotting the line resulting from your linear regression
into the same graph, to see the result of your hard work !
• A program that calculates the precision of your algorithm
